# Pneumonia Detection using ResNet-18

This project implements an image classification model for detecting Pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a **ResNet-18** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with **PyTorch**.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
The notebook covers:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Fine-tuning of `ResNet-18` model from `torchvision`
- Model training and saving the state dictionary
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics
- Visualization of training and validation loss and accuracy curves

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Google Colab

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
The trained ResNet-18 model achieved strong performance in classifying chest X-ray images as either 'Pneumonia' or 'Normal'. Evaluation metrics and accuracy/loss graphs are provided for model assessment.

## ðŸ“š Files Included
- `Pneumonia classification(model_state_dict(),_'_content_pneumonia_classifier_resnet18_pth').ipynb` : Google Colab notebook with full implementation and outputs.

## ðŸ”— How to Run
- Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
- Upload the dataset (if not already in Colab)
- Run all cells in order to train and evaluate the model
